## Display Behavior

### Priority Order
1. **Structured Data**: If `keyFeatures[]` or `systemRequirements[]` have data, display structured cards
2. **Rich Text Fallback**: If no structured data but `overallFeatures` or `requirements` exist, display rich text
3. **Default Content**: If no data exists, show default examples with proper icons

### Visual Design
- **Cards**: Gray background with subtle border
- **Icons**: Colored Lucide icons (24px size)
- **Typography**: Bold titles with gray descriptions
- **Layout**: Responsive 2-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile
- **Theme**: Matches your dark theme design perfectly

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. Admin creates structured features/requirements
2. Data stored in MongoDB with backward compatibility
3. Frontend fetches product data
4. ProductDetail component renders structured cards
5. Dynamic icon rendering using Lucide React library

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing products continue to work with rich text content
- New structured data takes priority when available
- Smooth migration path for existing products

## Example Product Creation

```javascript
// Example structured features data
keyFeatures: [
  {
    icon: "Check",
    title: "Advanced 2D Drafting", 
    description: "Precise drafting tools with automated workflows"
  },
  {
    icon: "Zap",
    title: "3D Modeling & Visualization",
    description: "Create stunning 3D models with photorealistic rendering"
  }
]

// Example structured requirements data  
systemRequirements: [
  {
    icon: "Monitor",
    title: "Operating System",
    description: "Windows 10/11 (64-bit) or macOS 10.15+"
  },
  {
    icon: "Cpu", 
    title: "Processor",
    description: "Intel Core i5 or equivalent AMD processor (2.5GHz or higher)"
  }
]
```

## Result

Your product detail pages now display features and requirements in the exact professional card layout shown in your AutoCAD 2025 design screenshots, with proper icons, typography, and spacing that matches the modern dark theme aesthetic.
