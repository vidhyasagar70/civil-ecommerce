# Quick Test Guide - Order Status Update

## 🚀 Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Setup
1. Open two browser windows/tabs side by side
2. **Window 1:** Login as customer → Go to "My Orders" page
3. **Window 2:** Login as admin → Go to "Orders Management" page

### Test Scenario
1. **In Admin Panel (Window 2):**
   - Find an order with status "Processing"
   - Change status to "Delivered" (Success)
   - Click update/save
   - ✅ Should see success toast notification
   - ✅ Admin panel should show "Success" immediately

2. **In My Orders Page (Window 1):**
   - Wait up to 30 seconds (usually faster)
   - ✅ Order status should automatically change to "Success"
   - No manual refresh needed!

3. **Test Other Statuses:**
   - Change to "Cancelled" → Should appear as "Cancelled"
   - Change to "Processing" → Should appear as "Processing"

### Alternative Test (Instant Verification)
1. After admin changes status, switch to My Orders tab
2. Click away to another tab, then back to My Orders
3. ✅ Should see updated status immediately (focus-based refresh)

## 🎯 Expected Results

| Admin Action | User Sees (within 30s) |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Set to "Processing" | Status: Processing (Blue) |
| Set to "Delivered" | Status: Success (Green) |
| Set to "Cancelled" | Status: Cancelled (Red) |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If status doesn't update:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify both browsers are logged in
3. Check network tab for failed API calls
4. Try manual refresh (F5)
5. Check backend logs for update confirmation

**Check Backend Logs:**
```
✅ Order [orderId] status updated to: [status]
```

**Check Frontend Console:**
```
✅ Update successful: { success: true, ... }
```

## ⏱️ Timing

- **Maximum wait:** 30 seconds (auto-refresh interval)
- **Typical wait:** 5-15 seconds (network + processing)
- **Instant option:** Switch tabs to trigger focus-based refresh
