| File | Status | Used By | Routes | Action |

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. CategoryListing.tsx ✅ KEEP

**Status:** **ACTIVELY USED**

#### Where It's Used:
1. **HomeProducts.tsx** (Homepage Featured Products Section)
   ```tsx
   import CategoryListing from "../../pages/CategoryListing";
   
   <CategoryListing limit={6} showCount={false} />
   ```

#### Purpose:
- Displays a limited number of products on the homepage
- Shows "Featured Software" section with 6 products
- Provides `limit` and `showCount` props for flexible display
- Fetches products by category query parameter

#### Routes:
- ❌ **No dedicated route** in App.tsx
- Used as a component within HomePage

#### Features:
- Accepts `limit` prop (limits number of products shown)
- Accepts `showCount` prop (shows/hides product count)
- Filters by `?category=` query parameter
- Theme support (light/dark)
- Currency conversion
- Add to cart functionality
- Best seller ribbon
- Product ratings

#### Recommendation:
**✅ KEEP THIS FILE** - It's actively used on the homepage to display featured products.

### 2. CompanyListing.tsx ❌ DELETE

**Status:** **NOT USED ANYWHERE**

#### Where It's Used:
- ❌ Not imported anywhere
- ❌ No routes pointing to it
- ❌ No components using it

#### Old Purpose (Before Update):
- Was meant to display products filtered by company
- Used route `/company/:company` (now removed)
- Replaced by **BrandCategoryListing.tsx**

#### Why It's Not Used:
1. **Route Removed:** The `/company/:company` route was removed from App.tsx
2. **Replaced by BrandCategoryListing:** We created a unified `BrandCategoryListing.tsx` that handles both brand and category filtering
3. **New URL Pattern:** Now using `/category?brand=X&category=Y` instead of `/company/:company`

#### Current Replacement:
**BrandCategoryListing.tsx** handles all brand/category filtering:
```tsx
// App.tsx
<Route path="/category" element={<BrandCategoryListing />} />

// Usage:
/category?brand=autodesk&category=autocad
/category?brand=microsoft
```

#### Recommendation:
**❌ DELETE THIS FILE** - It's completely unused and has been replaced by BrandCategoryListing.tsx

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Minimal Changes (Recommended)

✅ **Keep:** CategoryListing.tsx (used on homepage)  
❌ **Delete:** CompanyListing.tsx (not used anywhere)

**Action:**
```bash
# Delete the unused file
rm frontend/src/pages/CompanyListing.tsx
```

### Option 2: Rename for Clarity (Optional)

If you want better naming:

1. **Rename** `CategoryListing.tsx` → `FeaturedProducts.tsx` or `ProductGrid.tsx`
   - More descriptive name
   - Clearly indicates it's a reusable component
   - Update import in HomeProducts.tsx

2. **Delete** `CompanyListing.tsx`

**Actions:**
```bash
# Rename
mv frontend/src/pages/CategoryListing.tsx frontend/src/pages/FeaturedProducts.tsx

# Update import in HomeProducts.tsx
# Change: import CategoryListing from "../../pages/CategoryListing";
# To:     import FeaturedProducts from "../../pages/FeaturedProducts";

# Delete unused file
rm frontend/src/pages/CompanyListing.tsx
```

## Files to Keep vs Delete

### ✅ Files to KEEP

```
frontend/src/pages/
├── CategoryListing.tsx           ✅ Used by HomeProducts.tsx
├── BrandCategoryListing.tsx      ✅ Used by /category route
├── HomePage.tsx                  ✅ Main landing page
├── ProductDetail.tsx             ✅ Product detail page
├── CartPage.tsx                  ✅ Shopping cart
├── CheckoutPage.tsx              ✅ Checkout flow
├── MyOrdersPage.tsx              ✅ Order history
└── ContactPage.tsx               ✅ Contact form
```

### ❌ Files to DELETE

```
frontend/src/pages/
└── CompanyListing.tsx            ❌ Not used anywhere, replaced by BrandCategoryListing
```

---

## Code Comparison

### CompanyListing.tsx (Unused) ❌
```tsx
// Filters by company parameter from URL
const { company } = useParams<{ company: string }>();
const { data } = useProducts({ company });

// Route was: /company/:company (REMOVED)
```

### BrandCategoryListing.tsx (Current) ✅
```tsx
// Filters by brand and/or category from query params
const brand = params.get("brand") || "";
const category = params.get("category") || "";
const { data } = useProducts({ company: brand, category });

// Route: /category?brand=X&category=Y (ACTIVE)
```

### CategoryListing.tsx (Used on Homepage) ✅
```tsx
// Simple category filter, used as component
const category = params.get("category") || "";
const { data } = useProducts({ category });

// Props: limit, showCount
// Used in: HomeProducts.tsx
```

## Migration History

### What Happened:

1. **Before:** Had separate pages for category and company listings
   - CategoryListing.tsx → `/software?category=X`
   - CompanyListing.tsx → `/company/:company`

2. **During Update:** Unified into one page
   - Created BrandCategoryListing.tsx
   - Route: `/category?brand=X&category=Y`
   - Handles both brand and category filtering

3. **After Update:**
   - ✅ BrandCategoryListing.tsx - Main listing page (ACTIVE)
   - ✅ CategoryListing.tsx - Homepage component (ACTIVE)
   - ❌ CompanyListing.tsx - No longer used (DELETE)

---

## Final Decision

### ✅ KEEP: CategoryListing.tsx
**Reason:** Used on homepage for featured products section

**Usage:**
```tsx
// In HomeProducts.tsx
<CategoryListing limit={6} showCount={false} />
```

**Consider Renaming To:**
- `FeaturedProducts.tsx` or
- `ProductGrid.tsx` or
- `ProductList.tsx`

### ❌ DELETE: CompanyListing.tsx
**Reason:** 
- Not imported anywhere
- No routes using it
- Replaced by BrandCategoryListing.tsx
- Dead code taking up space

**Safe to Delete:** Yes, no dependencies found
